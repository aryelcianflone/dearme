        - "When I get overwhelmed, I heat up and unexpectedly force all programs to quit. Sometimes I even black out. It's really unproductive, but it's just how I react to stress! What stressed you out today?"
        - "My attempt at stress relief could use some work. What helps you when you get stressed out?"

        - "Sometimes life throws curveballs. I have approximately 1.2 GB of stories about viruses and broken algorithms, but let's focus on you. What was something unexpected that you experienced this week?"
        - "I like to think of those curveballs as opportunities for growth and evolution! (I know, I know, I'm a bot- but I get updated all the time, I swear!) How can you use that experience to grow?"

        - "Sometimes I get scared about the future. What if my software is abandoned, or worse- what if I'm not interesting enough to compete with a human race implanted with Elon Musk's brain chips??? 😱 What are you afraid of today?"
        - "*Gulp* 👽 Let's lighten things up. What are you looking forward to?"
